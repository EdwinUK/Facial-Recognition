# Facial-Recognition
This facial recognition application is my final year project for university, it will be able to detect faces, verify whether they're a real user or a spoof attack and then recognise them if they're in the database.

 ## Tasks
 - [x] Face detection using the MTCNN library.
 - [x] Function which crops the ROI and saves the image.
 - [x] Implement the Siamese model for face recognition.
 - [x] Integrate the face detection and face recognition modules.
 - [x] Implement the spoof detection module.
 - [x] Integrate the spoof detection with the other two modules.
 - [x] Design a GUI using Kivy
 - [ ] Improve the CNN models performances
