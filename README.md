# Facial-Recognition
This facial recognition application will be able to detect faces, verify whether it's a real user or a spoof attack and then recognise the face if it's in the database. The application is my final year project for university.
 
 ## Programmer
 - Edwin Rad
 
 ## Tasks to do
 - [ ] Implement face detection using the MTCNN library.
 - [ ] Create a function to crop and save the face once it's detected.
 - [ ] Implement a spoof detection class which will use a CNN to verify whether the image is a spoof attack.
 - [ ] Implement a face recognition class which will use a CNN to match the cropped face image to a face in the database if it exists.
