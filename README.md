# Facial-Recognition
This facial recognition application is my final year project for university, it will be able to detect faces, verify whether they're a real user or a spoof attack and then recognise them if they're in the database.
 
 ## Tasks
 - [x] Face detection using the MTCNN library.
 - [x] Function which crops the ROI and saves the image.
 - [ ] Implement the EfficientNet-B0 pre-trained model for face recognition.
 - [ ] Integrate the face detection and face recognition modules.
 - [ ] Implement the MobileNetV2 pre-trained model for spoof detection.
 - [ ] Integrate the spoof detection with the other two modules.
